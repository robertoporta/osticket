<h1>Solving a Ticket</h1>
This is an example where I solve a ticket in the help desk ticketing system osTicket. 
This simple simulation shows how I handle a user-submitted issue from start to finish, including reviewing the ticket, setting priorities, communicating with the user, and resolving the problem.

</p>
<p>
- In the ticket section of the Agent Panel, I can see that a new ticket has been submitted by a user. This view allows me to quickly identify new requests and review key details such as the issue description, category, and submission time before taking action.

</p>
<p>
- After reviewing the ticket and confirming that the issue does not affect productivity, I set the priority level to low. This ensures that more urgent issues are addressed first while keeping the workflow organized and efficient.
</p>

</p>
<p>
- Similarly, I set the SLA plan to severity level C. This determines the expected response and resolution time, ensuring that even lower-priority issues are handled within a reasonable timeframe according to company policy.

</p>
<p>
- After making these changes, I reply to the user with basic questions to gather more information. Collecting clear details early helps prevent unnecessary delays and allows me to better diagnose the root cause of the issue.
</p>

</p>
<p>
- When the user replies, I follow up by giving them steps that can potentially help resolve the issue. This collaborative approach helps users learn small troubleshooting steps while allowing me to confirm whether the problem is software, hardware, or configuration related.

</p>
<p>
- After identifying the issue and confirming that the user is fine with keeping the system as is, the ticket comes to an end. I make sure the user’s request has been fully addressed and that they are satisfied with the outcome.
</p>

</p>
<p>
- Finally, I change the ticket status to “Resolved” and close it. Properly closing tickets keeps the help desk system organized, ensures performance metrics stay accurate, and confirms that the issue has been officially completed.
